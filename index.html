				<h2><b>Pregel: A System for Large-Scale Graph Processing</b></h2>
				<p>
					<b>Pregel</b> Pregel is a a scalable and fault-tolerant platform with an API that is sufficiently exible to express arbitrary graph algorithms, that was designed to address distributed processing
					of large scale graphs. The high-level organization of Pregel is inspired by BSP.

				<p>Efficient processing of large graphs is challenging. Graph algorithms often exhibit poor locality of memory access, very little work per vertex, and a changing degree of parallelism
					over the course of execution. Pregel is a system developed to tackle these issues and provide a platform to process large graphs parallely.</p>

				<h3>Pregel Working Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Pregel computations consist of a sequence of iterations, called supersteps.
					<ul>
						<li>During a superstep the framework invokes a userdefined function for each vertex, conceptually in parallel. A function specifies behavior at a single vertex V and a single superstep S.</li>
						<li>The system passes messages around to each vertex from every other vertex which help discern the state of the vertices.</li>
						<li>The system can read messages sent to V in superstep S 1, send messages to other vertexes that will be received at superstep S + 1, and modify the state of V and its outgoing
							edges. Messages are typically sent along outgoing edges, but a message may be sent to any vertex whose identier is known.</li>
						<li>The vertex-centric approach is reminiscent of MapReduce in that users focus on a local action, processing each item independently, and the system composes these actions to lift
							computation to a large dataset.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pregel Model of Computation</h3>
				<p>
					Pregel computations consist of a sequence of iterations, called supersteps.
					<ul>
						<li>A typical Pregel computation consists of input, when the graph is initialized, followed by a sequence of supersteps separated by global synchronization points until
							the algorithm terminates, and nishing with output.</li>
						<li>The input to a Pregel computation is a directed graph in which each vertex is uniquely identied by a string vertex identier.</li>
						<li>Within each superstep the vertexes compute in parallel, each executing the same user-defined function that expresses the logic of a given algorithm.</li>
						<li>Algorithm termination is based on every vertex voting to halt. The algorithm as a whole terminates when all vertexes are simultaneously inactive and there are no messages in transit.</li>
						<li>The output of a Pregel program is the set of values explicitly output by the vertices.</li>
					</ul>
